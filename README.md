# Arch_Checker
The archk.py script is a Python script that checks the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) of all programs in a specified directory and its subdirectories. The script takes a directory path as a command-line argument and uses the os and subprocess modules to iterate over all files in the directory and its subdirectories and determine their architecture using the file command. The script then prints the path of each file and its architecture, with 32-bit programs printed in red and 64-bit programs printed in green. This makes it easy to quickly identify the architecture of all programs in a directory and ensure that they are compatible with the system they are running on.
